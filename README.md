# opencv

It's a program to detect road lanes for application like autonomus vehicals. Its a fairly simple program. OpenCV is being used for development of this program.

in this work we used Opencv (Python) to detect road lanes which could be very helpful for self-driving cars. we transformed the coloured frames of video to grayscale then used gaussianblur then used Hough transformation on the video frames to detect lines of the road lanes
